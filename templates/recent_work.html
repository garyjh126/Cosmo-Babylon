            <h3>AI Poker Bot</h3>
            <p>Using Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, this application consists of a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and a Monte-Carlo simulation that works in an environment of two bots. This project was built using Python alongside Django and the Open AI framework. The environment feeds rewards to the learner agent as a way of incentivising actions that performed well in a particular state. In the case of poker, optimal results are those which lead to building a higher profit margin. The agent must learn the optimal policy which determines the best path for an agent to take. A policy simply maps a state to an action. Solutions are tested using a unique approach taken by the researchers at the University of Alberta. This approach is called Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a self-play iterative algorithm that learns by accumulating regret for each action at each decision point. Acting as an initial approach, CFR was soon replaced by the idea of using deep reinforcement learning in the hopes that deep learning could solve the problem.</p>

            <h3>E-Commerce Site</h3>
            <p>In this day and age, with the growing popularity of the Internet and technological advancement, is it much quicker and easier to buy and sell online now than ever. Having an eCommerce website designed will give you the opportunity to reach out and offer your products and services to customers around the world, regardless of the distance and time zone. <br/>Customers will enjoy the round-the-clock convenience of being able to purchase what they want and when they want it, and you won't lose out on sales with an online shop that is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, compared to regular store hours.<br/> Diversify your product range and increase sales with intangible goods like eBooks that can be sold on your online store. Potential buyers are more likely to make purchases when they can place their order instantly, rather than waiting for a regular store to open. <br/> With good search engine optimisation, your website will appear in the top results of search engines such as Google. <br/> This application is highly customizable and can maintain user registrations as well as the recording of guest user payments.</p>
